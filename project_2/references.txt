The following resources were used for assistance with this project: 
The case study lesson that I completed, "Case Study: OpenStreetMap Data" 
The Udacity forums (mostly focusing on the responses that the user Myles gave) 
Stackoverflow.com for error message issues 
I examined all of the following projects (in addition to the provided sample project), 
and I did this for two reasons: 
1) to see different examples of how I could potentially organize my project AND 
2) to get ideas of different types of SQL queries that I could investigate
However, I would like to point out that the Vegan angle was entirely my own idea
