For this project, I chose to use a customized area in Northern Philadelphia, 
where some of my family is located:
* Minimum Latitude: -75.2179
* Maximum Latitude: -74.9439
* Minimum Longitude: 39.8945
* Maximum Longitude: 40.1883
From this larger OSM file, I created a sample file using a modified version of the code
that was provided in the "Project Description" (see sample.py) 
The sample OSM file is composed of every twentieth top-level element (k = 20) 
The original file size is: 203 MB
The sample file size is: 10 MB
